Each process or task is assigned a priority level, typically represented by a numerical value, where a higher number indicates a higher priority.</p><br><p>The scheduler selects the process with the highest priority to execute, and if multiple processes have the same priority, they are executed in a first-come, first-served (FCFS) manner.</p><br><br><div class="btn-wrapper"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19ArjCNA17YWeYXYizT1rm1DMrpa64Z5h/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span></span> <span></span> <span></span> <span></span> Download&nbsp; PDF </a><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p6NPRPOplHpOrf6w1UWPT8ULH-duez5s/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109965909797023020345&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank"><span></span> <span></span> <span></span> <span></span> Download&nbsp; PPT</a></div></div></section-pg1><section-pg12 class="project-pg1-sec"><div class="p-middd2"><h3>Types of Priority Scheduling</h3><p>___Priority scheduling divided into two main types___</p><br><br><br><div class="psfs-pg12"><p><b>Preemptive Scheduling:</b></p></div><br><p>In Preemptive Scheduling, the tasks are mostly assigned with their priorities. Sometimes it is important to run a task with a higher priority before another lower priority task, even if the lower priority task is still running. The lower priority task holds for some time and resumes when the higher priority task finishes its execution.</p><br><div class="psfs-pg12"><p><b>Non-Preemptive Scheduling:</b></p></div><br><p>In this type of scheduling method, the CPU has been allocated to a specific process. The process that keeps the CPU busy, will release the CPU either by switching context or terminating. It is the only method that can be used for various hardware platforms. That’s because it doesn’t need special hardware (for example, a timer) like preemptive scheduling.</p><br><br><br><br><h3>Characteristics of Priority Scheduling</h3><br><p>1. A CPU algorithm that schedules processes based on priority.<br><br>2. It used in Operating systems for performing batch processes.<br><br>3. If two jobs having the same priority are READY, it works on a FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED basis.<br><br>4. In priority scheduling, a number is assigned to each process that indicates its priority level.<br><br>5. Lower the number, higher is the priority.<br><br>6. In this type of scheduling algorithm, if a newer process arrives, that is having a higher priority than the currently running process, then the currently running process is preempted.</p><br><br><br><br><h3>Advantages of priority scheduling</h3><p>___Here, are benefits/pros of using priority scheduling method___</p><br><br><br><p>1. Easy to use scheduling method<br><br>2. Processes are executed on the basis of priority so high priority does not need to wait for long which saves time<br><br>3. This method provides a good mechanism where the relative important of each process may be precisely defined.<br><br>4. Suitable for applications with fluctuating time and resource requirements.</p><br><br><br><br><h3>Disadvantages of priority scheduling</h3><p>___Here, are cons/drawbacks of priority scheduling___</p><br><br><br><p>1. If the system eventually crashes, all low priority processes get lost.<br><br>2. If high priority processes take lots of CPU time, then the lower priority processes may starve and will be postponed for an indefinite time.<br><br>3. This scheduling algorithm may leave some low priority processes waiting indefinitely.<br><br>4. A process will be blocked when it is ready to run but has to wait for the CPU because some other process is running currently.<br><br>5. If a new higher priority process keeps on coming in the ready queue, then the process which is in the waiting state may need to wait for a long duration of time.</p><br><br><br><br><h3>Example of Priority Scheduling</h3><div class="btn-wrapper"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ywey_3o7inu2vABXCwYTGs6RKklITsvF/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank"><span></span> <span></span> <span></span> <span></span> Click here</a></div><br><br><br><br><h3>Algorithm for Priority Scheduling</h3><br><div class="psfs-pg12"><p><b>Input:</b></p></div><br><p>1. List of processes, each with a unique process ID.<br><br>2. Priority value for each process, indicating its priority level (a lower number typically indicates a higher priority).<br><br>3. Burst time (or execution time) for each process.<br><br>4. Arrival time (optional if you want to handle arrival times).</p><br><br><br><div class="psfs-pg12"><p><b>Output:</b></p></div><br><p>1. Order in which processes are scheduled for execution.<br><br>2. Waiting time for each process.<br><br>3. Turnaround time for each process.<br><br>4. Average waiting time.<br><br>5. Average turnaround time.</p><br><br><br><div class="psfs-pg12"><p><b>Algorithm: (Steps)</b></p></div><br><p>1. Initialize data structures: >>Create an empty ready queue to hold processes. >>Create variables to track the total waiting time and turnaround time.<br><br>2. Add all processes to the ready queue, each with its priority and burst time.<br><br>3. Sort the ready queue based on the priority of each process. Processes with higher priority (lower priority values) should come first in the queue.<br><br>4. Initialize a variable current_time to keep track of the current time.<br><br>5. While the ready queue is not empty: >>Dequeue the process with the highest priority from the ready queue. This process has the highest priority value. >>Execute the selected process on the CPU.<br><br>6. If the system uses preemptive priority scheduling (where a higher-priority process can preempt a running process): >>Whenever a new process arrives in the ready queue with a higher priority or the priority of the currently running process increases, preempt the currently running process and replace it with the higher-priority process. The preempted process is placed back in the ready queue.<br><br>7. If the system uses non-preemptive priority scheduling (where processes run to completion without interruption): >>Allow the currently running process to complete its execution without interruption, even if higher-priority processes arrive in the ready queue during its execution.<br><br>8. For each completed process, calculate: >>Waiting time: The waiting time for a process is the total time it spent waiting in the ready queue before it was executed. You can calculate this as waiting_time = turnaround_time - burst_time.<br><br>9. Update the total waiting time and turnaround time by adding the values for the completed process.<br><br>10. Continue this process until all processes have been executed.<br><br>11. Calculate the average waiting time by dividing the total waiting time by the number of processes.<br><br>12. Calculate the average turnaround time by dividing the total turnaround time by the number of processes.<br><br>13. Once all processes are executed, generate the scheduling sequence and display the results, including the scheduling order, waiting times, and turnaround times.</p><br><br><br><br><h3>Implementing priority scheduling in C Program</h3><br><div class="psfs-pg1"><p><b>Code</b></p></div><br><div class="psaio-pg1"><img src="images/psai.png" alt=""></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><div class="psfs-pg1"><p><b>Output</b></p></div><br><div class="psaio-pg1"><img src="images/psao.png" alt=""></div></div></section-pg12><section-pg12 class="project-pg1-sec"><div class="p-middd"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><div class="video-pg1"><p>Implementing priority scheduling in C Program, Full explanation with the help of Video.</p><br><div class="btn-wrapper"><a href="https://youtu.be/j3SuTE_PT10?si=VlsXtouTazvD0Hcc" target="_blank"><span></span> <span></span> <span></span> <span></span> Click here to open Video</a></div></div></div></section-pg12><section-pg12 class="project-pg1-sec"><div class="p-middd2"><h3>Analysis of Code - Priority Scheduling Program in C</h3><p>The worst-case temporal complexity of the priority scheduling program in C, which has sorting built in, is O(N^2).<br>As no more auxiliary space will be needed for operations because we have already provided all of the relevant values, such as burst time and priority, the space complexity will be O(1).</p></div></section-pg12><section-pg123 class="project-pg1-sec"><div class="p-middd3"><h3>Summary</h3><p>Priority scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority.
